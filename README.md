## Architecture - MVVM with Clean Architecure
 **Why MVVM?**

 -Besides being Google's Recommended Architectural Design Pattern, the usage of Viewmodel is one of the most obvious reason why use MVVM. Being Lifecycle aware helps maintain UI State when Configuration Change happens.

**Why Clean Architecture**


-In my own personal opinion, applying Clean Architecture prevents having 'God' ViewModel that contains all the business Logic of a specific screen with the help of using 'UseCases' or 'Interactors' which contains a reusable single flow of logic that is agnostic to it's platform. It also Adhere's in using the SOLID Principles that descibes a good app architecture looks like.

**BONUS**: **Why use Multi-module?** It helps in having faster build times and is beneficial in the long run when working with multiple teams in one app/project.

## Persistence -SQLite Database with Room Library

-The Room library helps in handling a more elegant way in using the built-in Local Database of Android.
